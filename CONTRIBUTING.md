# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To maintain consistency and quality, we kindly ask all contributors to follow these guidelines.

## Branching Strategy

All new work must begin from a new branch created off the latest `develop` branch.

### Accepted Branch Name Formats:
- `feat/<short-description>` â€” New feature implementation
- `fix/<short-description>` â€” Bug fixes
- `chore/<short-description>` â€” Maintenance tasks
- `docs/<short-description>` â€” Documentation updates
- `style/<short-description>` â€” Code style or formatting changes
- `refactor/<short-description>` â€” Code restructuring
- `ci/<short-description>` â€” CI/CD pipeline or config updates
- `revert/<short-description>` â€” Reverts to a previous state
- `build/<short-description>` â€” System build updates
- `perf/<short-description>` â€” Performance improvements
- `test/<short-description>` â€” Add/Update tests

---

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard to keep our history readable and automated tooling effective.

### Use the following format:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The commit scope is **optional**, but **it must be included when modifying a specific package** in this monorepository.  
> We recommend always defining a scope to improve clarity and traceability.

```
<type>(<scope?>): <description>
```

### Examples:

- `revert: previous commit`
- `fix(react): handle null pointer in user model`
- `feat(core): add search endpoint for articles`
- `docs(root): update installation guide`
- `chore(release): bump dependencies`
- `refactor(utils): simplify date parsing logic`
- `style(vue): apply prettier formatting`
- `test(core): add unit test for login flow`
- `ci(workflow): update GitHub Actions node version`
- `perf(utils): improve search logic`
- `build(root): update nx build process`

### Avoid:

- `updated code`
- `fixed stuff`
- `final changes`
- `misc updates`

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** (if you don't have write access).
2. **Create your branch** using an appropriate prefix as described above.
3. Make your changes and ensure:
   - Code follows project standards and style.
   - All tests pass (run `npm test`, `yarn test`, or equivalent).
   - You have added/updated documentation as needed.
4. **Commit your changes** with meaningful commit messages.
5. **Push your branch** and open a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `master` branch.

---

## Pull Request Lifecycle

- PR must target `develop` branch.
- All status checks (CI, tests, linters) must pass.
- Reviews and approvals are required before merging.

Once your changes are merged into `develop`, a new PR must be created for the `master` branch.

---

## Release Process

After a PR is approved and merged into `master`, the release process is triggered **manually** by maintainers.
